# Accept/Reject Workflow Feature

## Overview

The Accept/Reject Workflow feature provides a seamless and intuitive way to review and apply AI-generated content changes in Valinor Studio. When AI generates content for proposal sections, users can review the changes in a diff editor with sleek Cursor-style Accept/Reject buttons in the toolbar.

## Features

### üéØ Core Workflow
- **Diff Editor Integration**: Shows side-by-side comparison of original vs generated content
- **Sleek Cursor-Style Buttons**: Accept (‚úì) and Reject (‚úó) buttons in the diff editor toolbar
- **Modal Confirmation**: Prevents accidental acceptance/rejection with confirmation dialogs
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Temporary files and UI elements are cleaned up after actions

### üîÑ Workflow Steps

1. **Generate Content**: Right-click on a section header and select "Generate [Section] Content"
2. **AI Model Selection**: Choose from GPT-4, Claude-3, or Gemini-Pro
3. **Content Generation**: AI generates comprehensive content for the section
4. **Diff Review**: Side-by-side diff editor opens showing original vs generated content
5. **Accept/Reject Decision**: Use the sleek buttons in the toolbar to accept or reject changes
6. **Confirmation**: Confirm your decision in the modal dialog
7. **Apply Changes**: Accepted changes are applied to the proposal.md file
8. **History Tracking**: Accepted changes are automatically added to suggestion history

### üé® UI Design

#### Accept Button (‚úì)
- **Icon**: Checkmark symbol
- **Color**: Prominent background (green theme)
- **Position**: Right side of status bar, priority 100
- **Tooltip**: "Accept the generated changes"

#### Reject Button (‚úó)
- **Icon**: X symbol
- **Color**: Error background (red theme)
- **Position**: Right side of status bar, priority 99
- **Tooltip**: "Reject the generated changes"

### üìã Session Management

#### DiffSession Interface
```typescript
interface DiffSession {
    originalUri: vscode.Uri;
    generatedUri: vscode.Uri;
    originalContent: string;
    generatedContent: string;
    sectionName: string;
    document: vscode.TextDocument;
    position: vscode.Position;
    model: string;
}
```

#### Session Lifecycle
1. **Creation**: Session created when diff editor opens
2. **Active State**: Session remains active while diff is open
3. **Action**: User accepts or rejects changes
4. **Cleanup**: Temporary files deleted, status bar items hidden
5. **History**: Accepted changes added to suggestion history

### üîß Technical Implementation

#### Commands Registered
- `valinorStudio.acceptSectionChanges`: Accepts the generated changes
- `valinorStudio.rejectSectionChanges`: Rejects the generated changes

#### Key Methods
- `showDiffWithAcceptReject()`: Creates diff editor with accept/reject buttons
- `addAcceptRejectButtons()`: Adds status bar items for accept/reject actions
- `acceptSectionChanges()`: Handles acceptance workflow
- `rejectSectionChanges()`: Handles rejection workflow
- `cleanupSession()`: Cleans up resources after action

#### File Management
- **Temporary Files**: Created with unique session IDs
- **Auto Cleanup**: Files deleted after 5 minutes if not acted upon
- **Workspace Integration**: Files created in workspace root with `.` prefix

### üéØ User Experience

#### Accept Workflow
1. Click the ‚úì Accept button in the diff editor toolbar
2. Confirm acceptance in the modal dialog
3. Changes are applied to the original proposal.md file
4. Success message displayed: "‚úÖ Changes accepted for [Section Name]"
5. Diff editor closes automatically
6. Changes added to suggestion history

#### Reject Workflow
1. Click the ‚úó Reject button in the diff editor toolbar
2. Confirm rejection in the modal dialog
3. Changes are discarded
4. Rejection message displayed: "‚ùå Changes rejected for [Section Name]"
5. Diff editor closes automatically
6. No changes made to the original file

### üîí Error Handling

#### Session Expiration
- Sessions expire after 5 minutes of inactivity
- Temporary files are automatically cleaned up
- User receives error message if trying to act on expired session

#### File System Errors
- Graceful handling of file read/write errors
- User-friendly error messages
- Automatic cleanup attempts

#### Document State
- Validates document state before applying changes
- Handles cases where document has been modified externally
- Preserves user's work in case of conflicts

### üìä Integration Points

#### Suggestion History
- Accepted changes automatically added to suggestion history
- Includes metadata: section name, AI model, timestamp, file path
- Enables future review and comparison of accepted suggestions

#### AI Models
- Supports multiple AI models: GPT-4, Claude-3, Gemini-Pro
- Model selection integrated into the workflow
- Model information stored with suggestion history

#### Context Menu
- Right-click on section headers to generate content
- Seamless integration with existing proposal.md structure
- Supports all markdown header levels (## and above)

### üé® Visual Design

#### Status Bar Integration
- Accept/Reject buttons appear in the status bar when diff is active
- Buttons are positioned on the right side for easy access
- Color-coded for quick visual identification

#### Modal Dialogs
- Clean, modern confirmation dialogs
- Clear action buttons (Accept/Reject vs Cancel)
- Descriptive messages with section names

#### Success/Error Messages
- Consistent emoji usage (‚úÖ for success, ‚ùå for rejection)
- Clear, actionable error messages
- Non-intrusive notification system

### üîß Configuration

#### Timeout Settings
- Default session timeout: 5 minutes
- Configurable cleanup intervals
- Automatic resource management

#### File Naming
- Temporary files use session ID for uniqueness
- Hidden files (prefixed with `.`) to avoid workspace clutter
- Automatic cleanup prevents file system pollution

### üìà Future Enhancements

#### Potential Improvements
- Keyboard shortcuts for accept/reject actions
- Batch accept/reject for multiple sections
- Customizable timeout periods
- Enhanced diff visualization options
- Integration with version control systems

#### Advanced Features
- Partial acceptance of changes (hunk-level)
- Custom accept/reject rules
- Integration with external review systems
- Advanced diff algorithms for better comparison

## Usage Examples

### Basic Workflow
1. Open `proposal.md` in VS Code
2. Right-click on a section header (e.g., "## Technical Approach")
3. Select "Generate Technical Approach Content"
4. Choose AI model (GPT-4, Claude-3, or Gemini-Pro)
5. Review generated content in diff editor
6. Click ‚úì Accept or ‚úó Reject button
7. Confirm action in modal dialog
8. Changes applied or discarded accordingly

### Advanced Usage
- Generate multiple sections in sequence
- Compare different AI models for the same section
- Use suggestion history to review past accepted changes
- Integrate with business profile enrichment for personalized content

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Session expired**: Regenerate the section content
- **File not found**: Ensure you're working in a valid workspace
- **Permission errors**: Check file write permissions
- **AI generation failed**: Try a different AI model or regenerate

### Debug Information
- Check the Output panel for detailed error messages
- Review the suggestion history for successful generations
- Verify workspace folder structure and permissions
- Ensure all required dependencies are installed
